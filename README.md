# Broker-API-Scraping


This script aims to collect the minutely capital flow of stocks from Futu API.

Since the broker API does not provide the historical capital flow, this script would retrieve the data from the live stream and insert the data into MongoDB.

To connect the broker API, the user needs to install Futu API software.
